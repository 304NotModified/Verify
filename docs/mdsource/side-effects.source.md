# Side effects

## more likely to create tests

 * Less time need to be spent creating assert code
 * since on snapshot can verify many things, fewer tests. more value from fewer test

## more likely to maintain tests

 * valid changes in code can more easily be reflected in test asserts
 * scrubbers reduces fragility


## representation of the evolution of an app is in source control

 * screens
 * reports
 * api changes
 * sql changes


## Better communication 

with product owners/designers etc

 * can show them rendered reports/screens


## Simplify deployment approval

 * before after sql schema snapshot
 * show rendered screens


## Simplify debugging

 * often over-capture data 
 * often temorarily capture more data dusing debugging
